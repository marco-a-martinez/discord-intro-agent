      "content": "Hey everyone, I just thought I'd share my current setup and see if anyone has any thoughts/recommendations on best practices. I feel there's probably a better way but I just can't think of it as of now. My current setup is that I have a single vm (which has a couple of other containers on it) that uses docker for external services. I'm using traefik hosted on the same system and their docker labels to expose it coder for my domain. I currently have traefik_proxy and coder_backend docker.  In order for to have coder properly communicate with itself, I had to set an alias on the traefik_proxy network for the traefik container itself for the domain of my coder instance which allowed all health checks to complete correct. This made everything work except for the workspace connections themselves. By default, workspaces are added to the default docker network and as a result were not able to access the access url and download the coder agent. To fix this, I had to adjust the docker container terraform template to use the traefik_proxy network so that it has the correct routing for the access url. Now this works fine as of now but ideally to create some separation between the workspaces and the other containers on the vm itself, I'd like to create a separate docker network that the only the coder container and workspaces have access to for better separation between other services. Does anyone have any recommendations for this setup? If anyone wants to see my compose files/terraform configs or wants some clarification, let me know. I wanted to try and not make this too big of a post (even though it's already an essay).",

This PR removed the `coder_ai_task` resource from the agentapi module, and it was not added back to claude code module, so now users of  the claude code module need to add this themselves. The docs explicitly say that this shouldn't be necessary.\n\nMight be worth updating the docs and/or the modules to address this.

I'm looking to set it up in a way that we have a central template, but allow product teams to define things like their VS Code extensions in their .devcontainers.json. I started down the route of using envbuilder, but see some limitations in the devcontainer support of that project.\nThis is really an open question to see if any of you have implemented something similar that honors the full devcontainers spec, and if so how you went about it?",

I'm doing my setup gitlab ce etc. Love to have quick link in gitlab tickets/issues which deploy new env like how eclipse che or other pod things does via devcontainers.  Or could have quick link to throw issue to ai. Ai will read ticket spin up server code it maybe in future (idk 3 6 month later :D) it can test then create pr push then kill himself. There are similar paid tools but having this in locally insane idea. \n\nOf course i'm not like enterprice tier company, just simple guy doing some freelance and looking for enhancements on his workflows. Wish you have more and more enterprice custumers and of course less locked feature in the future for us. \n\nYea future dev tools are insanely help devs and i think coder is the tool. Of course we could integrate coder apis with n8n like stuff, pre process requirements etc. Bind the missing gaps, create autonomous agents (locally) and end up one man agency 😄 then all matter is marketing.

      "content": "Hi, I’m a DevOps engineer working for a small business.\nAfter using Coder.com for a month (with the enterprise license trial), I’d like to share some feedback.\n\n## Why I Chose Coder\nMy team is small, with only a few permanent members, while most contributors come and go. I opted for devcontainers or cloud development primarily to reduce costs and onboarding time for these temporary contributors.\n\nI prioritized Coder because it offers a self-hosted and self-managed solution.\n\nTL;DR: A self-hosted and self-managed solution that enables one-click-ready-to-dev setups.\n\n## First Impressions\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the documentation, which seemed detailed and comprehensive. It was easy to set up using Helm (my preferred method), and the interface was designed to be user-friendly—even for the most monkey users.\n\nHowever, the documentation wasn’t as complete as it appeared. There’s a relationship between the Coder repo and the Envbuilder repo, but Envbuilder is rarely mentioned in the docs. To get things working, I had to piece together information from the Coder docs and the `readme.md` of Envbuilder.\n\n## Features Overview\nThe features of Coder are what inspired me to write this feedback.\n\nFirst, support terraform  in templates. If you’re familiar with Terraform, you literally can practically do anything with it. Second, greate flexibility. Coder provides two powerful resources: `coder_app` and `coder_script`. `coder_script `allows you to execute scripts. `coder_app` enables open access to ports when necessary.\n\nThe GitHub repo `coder/modules` contains Terraform modules to help you enhance your templates. However, I wouldn’t recommend using them directly due to their instability. Instead, I suggest customizing the `coder_app` and `coder_script` resources based on these modules before applying them to your templates.\n\nAdditionally, Coder offers permission hierarchies for templates and workspaces, though they didn’t significantly affect my experience.\n\n## My Experience\nIt took me a week to set up a cloud development environment to achieve a one-click ready-to-dev experience for new users.\n\nAfter discovering the power of Terraform, I set up additional one-click options for creating JupyterLab, etc, ...nearly anything else I needed.\n\n## Comparison with Similar Platforms\n### Lapdev\nLapdev builds from devcontainer.json remarkably fast and doesn’t seem to have the limitations I faced with Envbuilder. However, it doesn’t yet support Kubernetes self-hosted setups (strangely), so I reluctantly ruled it out.\n\n### GitHub Codespaces\nCoder clearly aims to be an alternative to Codespaces, so there’s not much to elaborate here.\n\n### Gitpod\nGitpod stopped supporting self-hosted environments around late October 2024. While that’s a loss for the self-hosted community, it aligns with Gitpod’s focus on other areas.\n\n### JetBrains Space\nDoesn’t allow self-managed setups.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nCoder provides a solution that meets the requirements I was looking for: self-hosted, self-managed, highly flexible, and easy to use for new users.\n\nHowever, its build times are incredibly slow—so slow that the existence of Lapdev only highlights this shortcoming further.",

You don’t need an external script or to rebuild the image, just drop a file in the right folder and it’ll run automatically on container start.\n\nSetup Steps\n1. Find your config volume path In the TrueNAS Apps UI, check where /config is mounted on your host. It should look something like:\n/mnt/pool/apps/code-server/config\n\n2. Create the startup script on the host (inside the config volume):\nmkdir -p /mnt/pool/apps/code-server/config/custom-cont-init.d\nnano /mnt/pool/apps/code-server/config/custom-cont-init.d/install-python.sh\n\n3. Add this content to the script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Installing Python...\"\napt-get update\napt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv\necho \"Python installation complete!\"\n\n4. Make it executable:\nchmod +x /mnt/pool/apps/code-server/config/custom-cont-init.d/install-python.sh\n\n5. Restart the container\nThe LinuxServer.io image will automatically run any scripts in that custom-cont-init.d folder on startup. \n\nOptional: After restarting, check the container logs for:\nPython installation complete!\n\n📘 Docs: https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/container-customization/#custom-scripts",

Install Python to a persistent path\nUse pyenv or compile Python to a location inside /config (e.g., /config/.local/). Add to your .bashrc in /config:\n\nexport PATH=\"/config/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nThis survives reboots without needing to reinstall.\n\n3. DOCKER_MODS (limited applicability)\nIf your app is LinuxServer.io-based AND the TrueNAS app UI lets you add custom environment variables:\n\nDOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-package-install\nINSTALL_PACKAGES=python3|python3-pip\nMany TrueNAS catalog apps don't expose this option without editing the Helm chart (advanced).\n\n4. Consider Jailmaker (recommended alternative)\nhttps://github.com/Jip-Hop/jailmaker creates persistent Debian jails on TrueNAS SCALE where all installations survive reboots. This avoids fighting the Kubernetes abstraction layer entirely and gives you a normal Linux environment.\n\nBottom line\nOption 1 (if LinuxServer.io image) or Option 4 (Jailmaker) are probably your best bets. The TrueNAS Apps system abstracts away a lot of container configuration, which can make customizations like this frustrating.",

This means:\n- When workspace is **starting**: `start_count = 1` → creates 1 agent → `coder_agent.dev` is a list with 1 element\n- When workspace is **stopping**: `start_count = 0` → creates 0 agents → `coder_agent.dev` is an **empty list**\n\n**Your error occurred because:**\n\nWhen the workspace stops, Terraform runs again. At that point `coder_agent.dev[0]` doesn't exist (empty tuple), so your `coder_script` referencing `coder_agent.dev[0].id` fails.\n\n**The fix:**\n\nAdding `count = data.coder_workspace.me.start_count` to your `coder_script` makes it conditional too:\n- Workspace starting → agent exists, script exists, reference works\n- Workspace stopping → agent doesn't exist, script doesn't exist, no reference error\n\nThis is the standard pattern in Coder templates - any resource that depends on the agent needs the same `count` to stay in sync.",

The AI in the Mux documentation site says:\n\n```\nmux does support file editing through tools like file_edit_replace_string, file_edit_insert, file_read, and bash. However, tool calling capability depends on the model itself, not just mux.\n\nThe issue with your local Ollama models (IBM Granite4, Qwen3-coder) is likely that these models may not reliably support the tool/function calling format that mux uses. mux is built on the Vercel AI SDK and provides tools to models, but the model must properly understand and invoke those tools.\n\nThe limitation: Not all local models handle tool calling well. mux's documentation notes that \"different models react very differently to the same set of tools and instructions.\" Some smaller or less capable models may struggle with structured tool use.\n\nYou might try models known for better tool calling support, or check if your Ollama models have specific tool-calling variants.\n```\n\nSince I know this works in Zed, are there other suggested models to try? Trying to shortcut the list since there are so many models and it takes time to download them all to the Spark. Thanks.",

This lets the workspace clone the relevant git repo to work with at startup.\n\nWithout this, I would have to make a new coder task template for every git repo I want to work with in tasks. Is there something I'm missing, or this is how the tasks feature works at this time?\n\nSome \"workarounds\" I've thought of:\n\n1. Include an instruction in the prompt to clone the git repo as the first step. This relies on the LLM correctly parsing and executing the git clone command before starting work, and is less deterministic.\n\n2. Hack this by using a regex in the terraform template to extract the git repo URL from the prompt (like looking for a pattern such as `coder_parameter_git_repo_url: https://...` inside the prompt text and establishing a terraform local value for use within the template, like for doing `git clone` within the workspace startup script.\n\nWhat is the recommended way to re-use a coder task template across git repositories?\n\nRunning coder version: v2.29.1+59cdd7e",
