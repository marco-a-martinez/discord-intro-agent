The top issues in this channel are primarily technical in nature, with \"coder setup issue\" being the most frequent request at 1 request, followed by \"general help\" and \"coder agent connection issue\". However, since our previous conversation showed a different set of top issues (coder setup issue, general help, ssh issue, authentication issue, vs code issue), it appears that these issues have reduced in frequency. Notably, there is no clear spike or trend in specific technical problems, suggesting that users are seeking general assistance and troubleshooting for various technical challenges.\n\nTop 5 Active Threads (5+ replies):\n1.) \"Help figuring out why my workspace is not being created, and getting it to.\" (20 replies)\n2.) \"This server is pretty good, However it lacks activity.\" (16 replies)\n3.) \"code server on truenas installing python\" (7 replies)\n4.) \"Does anyone know of a simple way to make it possible to ssh into a workspace using termius?\" (7 replies)\n5.) \"Docker-in-Docker devcontainers issue with VSCode\" (6 replies)",
